# this is a very simple example of using Modulus
# this just tells you if the number assigned to 'n' is even
# you should try adding another line or two to check for odd and print
#  maybe even use the INPUT command to ask for a number and then check it
n = 60
if n % 2 == 0:
   print("n is an even number")
