# ALAS, reaching the goal of 101 !!
# this is my favorite script so far :)
# remember that the second number in the range is NOT included in the count
# so i had to go one number higher in order to get to 101 in the count
# and again, just switch around the two print statements to see the difference
x = 102
for val in range(1,x):
    #print(val)
    print(val, end=' ')
print("Mission Accomplished!!")
