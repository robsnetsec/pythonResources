# this is a very simple FOR loop to iterate thru a range of numbers
# and you should edit the print statement to display in vertical column
# or edit the print statement to include a space between the numbers
# or edit the range values to starting counting from 1 instead of 0
for i in range(11):
    print(i, end='')
